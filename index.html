      <h2>💡 Tips & Warnings</h2>
       <p>Stack deals carefully — check dates, clip digital coupons before checkout, and screenshot rebates. Rebates can vary from user to user, especially on Fetch and Ibotta. New Ibotta users usually have much better rebates than others. For example a new Ibotta user will usually have a lot of cereal deals for General Mills. Use these at Giant Eagle during a $5 off 5 deal when its on sale for $2.99 and combine with a 5% back credit card or PayPay and 15% back on Upside you can get cereal for under $1.00</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>I use a different e-mail for Swagbucks, InboxDollars, Mypoints, Tada, BeFrugal. I don't know if it matters but they are owned by the same company and "technically" you shouldn't repeat the same rebate. Also as these are the same parent company, you CAN NOT submit the same reciept to more than one of them. For example if there is a $7 rebate on Tyson Nuggets, and it can be redeemed 2x per week, in one shopping trip you can buy twelve bags of nuggets. Do this with three purchases, four bags on each receipt. One receipt each to Swagucks, InboxDollars, and Mypoints. As long as they are separate receipts each site will give you back fourteen dollars.</p>
      <p>One trick is to link your Swagbucks or MyPoints account to your Tada account and use their online receipt scanning to catch extra rebates that may have been missed when scanning manual, or sometimes it will glitch and double up.</p>
